## How to use

Start a new .tex file from this template in your editor and write the essay in the file. There are comments in the template to help you know how to write.

On finishing writing, compile in the following order: xelatex, bibtex, xelatex, xelatex. The bibliography file (.bib) should be put in the same directory with the .tex file. I strongly suggest you not name the .tex file with Chinese characters or spaces.
